## Description
For this project, I developed a custom WordPress website for **Pressure King**, a commercial pressure washer store based in Closter, NJ. The website was built from scratch with a strong focus on functionality, design, and lead generation.

Pressure King specializes in high-performance cleaning solutions, offering products like:
- **Commercial Hot Pressure Washers**: These powerful machines use high temperatures to dissolve grease, grime, and contaminants, making them ideal for industrial machinery, automotive parts, and tough surfaces.
- **Commercial Cold Pressure Washers**: Designed for precision cleaning, these pressure washers are perfect for outdoor surfaces, vehicles, and equipment.
- **Trailer Setups**: Mobile pressure washers that enable on-site industrial cleaning, offering flexibility for customers.
- **Refurbished Pressure Washers**: A budget-friendly option for those who need professional-grade equipment but at a more affordable price.
- **Advanced Floor Cleaning Equipment**: This includes machines like scrubbers, vacuums, and air blowers, designed to clean floors efficiently and effectively in commercial spaces.

### Development Process
I worked closely with a **UI/UX designer team** to ensure that the website followed a **user-centered design**. The goal was to create a seamless and intuitive experience for users while ensuring the site was fully functional, visually appealing, and optimized for lead generation. We used a **Figma design** as the foundation, which I translated into a live website. 

Key development highlights:
- **Custom Sections**: I created several custom sections on the website, including product categories, featured products, and a contact form, ensuring they aligned with the business’s goals.
- **Theme and Plugin Customization**: I customized the theme and plugins to meet the specific needs of the business, making sure the website functions smoothly and delivers a high-quality user experience.
- **Lead Funnel-Based Design**: The site was designed to capture leads efficiently. I integrated a lead funnel strategy, making it easier for customers to find the products they need and get in touch with the business.

In addition to working on the technical aspects, I collaborated with the **marketing team** to align the website design with their campaign goals. We ensured that the site’s structure and features supported the marketing efforts, leading to increased engagement and higher conversion rates. The team and I worked together to optimize the site for **SEO** and ensure the design would be effective in driving marketing campaigns, such as promotions and seasonal offers.

This project also incorporated workflow automation tools like **Salesforce** for CRM management and **n8n** to automate blog posting, which helped streamline operations for the business.
